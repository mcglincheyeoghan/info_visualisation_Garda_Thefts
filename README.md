# info_visualisation_Garda_Thefts
This was the second assignment I did as part of the Information Visualisation module. This is an assignment in which the number of thefts reported in each county each year between 2003 and 2015 has been visualised using Vega-Lite. The code can be viewed in the EoghanMcGlinchey_18300093_garda_thefts.vl.json file, and the plots can be visualised and interacted with in the EoghanMcGlinchey_18300093_garda_thefts.html file. In this html file, you will be able to:
1. Click and drag the area plot at the bottom, to select a time period.
2. Click on a bar in the bar chart to select a region or county, you can select as many regions or counties as you wish using shift+click.
3. Hover over various circles, which represent Garda stations, upon which, you will be able to see the name of the station and the number of thefts reported, given the time period you have selected.
The data for this assignment can be found on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colmr/vis_class/master/Thefts2003-2015.csv.
